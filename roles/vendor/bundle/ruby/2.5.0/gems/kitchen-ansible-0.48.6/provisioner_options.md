# Ansible Install Options

Kitchen-ansible is very flexible in how it installs ansible:

It installs it in the following order:

* if require_ansible_omnibus is set to true

  Installs using the omnibus_ansible script specified in the ansible_omnibus_url parameter and passes the ansible_version if specied as -v option.

* If require_ansible_source is set to true

  Install require packages and download the ansible source from github from  master or from a branch specified in the parameter install_source_rev.

* if require_pip is set to true

  Install require packages and then installs ansible using the python pip command and ansible version must be specified. This allows a specific version of ansible to be installed.

* if require_ansible_repo is set to true (the default)

  Installs from the operation system repository only with the ansible version that is in the particular repository and will use the ansible_version in the package name where appropriate.

NOTE:  Set to ansible_package_name to 'ansible' when installing from the CentOS/Redhat extras repo, instead of the EPEL.

## Ansible Inventory

Ansible has the concept of an [inventory](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_inventory.html).

Ansible then connects to these servers and processes the playbook against the server.

See also [Host inventories](https://ansible-tips-and-tricks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ansible/inventory/).


### ansible Inventory parameter

if you have an ansible inventory file you can specify it in the ansible_inventory parameter in the .kitchen.yml file.
```yaml
  ansible_inventory: myinventoryfile.txt
```
or if you have an ansible.cfg  file specify
```yaml
  ansible_inventory: none
```
it will look for the file in the root of your repository.

or it can be a directory from the root of your repository and contain scripts to implement [dynamic inventory](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_dynamic_inventory.html)

### hosts parameter

if you don't specify an inventory file then you must specify the hosts parameter in the .kitchen.yml file.

kitchen ansible uses this information to create a hosts file that is used by ansible with the ansible command is run.

it can either be a name of a single server

```yaml
hosts: myhost
```

or any array of hosts:

```yaml
hosts:
  - myhost1
  - myhost2
```

the hosts file that is generated always contains in the first line

```yaml
localhost ansible_connection=local
```
so that it will process against the locahost.

and it will create a hosts file that includes the hosts you specify

```yaml
localhost ansible_connection=local
myhost1
myhost2
localhost
```


## Copying Additional Files

Several parameters have been developed rather organically to support the requirement to copy additional files beyond the ones in the standard ansible locations.
* These could be used for the verification phase later
* additional files required by the application
* or these could be ansible roles

### additional_copy_path  - Arbitrary array of files and directories to copy into test environment
* If you specify a directory it will copy all the files to /tmp/kitchen with the directory structure
* if you specify the full file name they are copied to the top of the /tmp/kitchen folder in the server and the path is ignored.
i.e. if we have a directory data/ containing file xyz.txt
```
  additional_copy_path:
    - data/xyz.txt
```
it will copy data/xyz.txt to /tmp/kitchen/xyz.txt
* if you specify the directory without the filename it will preserve the path when copying to /tmp/kitchen.
```
  additional_copy_path:
    - data
```
it will copy data/xyz.txt to /tmp/kitchen/data/xyz.txt
NOTE: additional_copy_path does copy files that are links but if you specify the full file path only the file name is copied to /tmp/kitchen

### recursive_additional_copy_path
This copies the directories in a resursive fashion which can work better for some directory structures
* It does not support specifying files with paths. i.e. you can only specify files at the top level of the repository
```
  recursive_additional_copy_path:
  - xyz.txt
```
* It does support copying directories in a similar fashion to additional_copy_path but uses recursion to discover the files in the directory structure which can be
problematic with files with links.
```
  recursive_additional_copy_path:
    - data
```
### additional_copy_role_path
This is the same as additional_copy_path but adds the extra paths to the ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH ansible command parameter.

### ignore_paths_from_root and ignore_extensions_from_root
During recursive_additional_copy_path or additional_copy_role_path there are 2 additional parameters.
(NOTE: These don't apply with additional_copy_path)
* ignore_paths_from_root defaults to empty array []. This causes these paths to be ignored.
* ignore_extensions_from_root defaults to an array containg ['.pyc']. This causes files with these extensions to be ignored.
as these are implemented with the 'Find.prune' command they can be problematic with file links.


## Configuring Provisioner Options

The provisioner can be configured globally or per suite, global settings act as defaults for all suites, you can then customise per suite, for example:

```yaml
---
driver:
  name: vagrant

provisioner:
  name: ansible_playbook
  roles_path: roles
  hosts: tomcat-servers
  require_ansible_repo: true
  ansible_verbose: true
  ansible_verbosity: 2
  ansible_diff: true

platforms:
- name: nocm_ubuntu-12.04
  driver_plugin: vagrant
  driver_config:
    box: nocm_ubuntu-12.04
    box_url: http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/ubuntu-server-12042-x64-vbox4210-nocm.box

suites:
 - name: default
```

### Per-suite Structure

It can be beneficial to keep different Ansible layouts for different suites. Rather than having to specify the roles, modules, etc for each suite, you can create the following directory structure and they will automatically be found:

```
$kitchen_root/ansible/$suite_name/roles
$kitchen_root/ansible/$suite_name/modules
$kitchen_root/ansible/$suite_name/Ansiblefile
```

Multiple Line Structure
```yaml
provisioner::
  command: |
    sudo -s <<SERVERSPEC
    cd /opt/gdc/serverspec-core
    export SERVERSPEC_ENV=$EC2DATA_ENVIRONMENT
    export SERVERSPEC_BACKEND=exec
    serverspec junit=true tag=~skip_in_kitchen check:role:$EC2DATA_TYPE
    SERVERSPEC
```
